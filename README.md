## Summary of Findings

> In the exploratory part i didn't find a strong pattern to follow but between the age and duration i found a weak positive correalation, Talking about the duration distribution, at first the output wasn't clear enough, For that i applied the logarithmic scale a unimodal histogram with normal distribution was plotted.

> I plotted the count for each user type and for each gender, i was surprised by the result, Male and subscribers was the two dominant categories in overall terms.

> Teenagers in the 20s and below should be more exposed to sport ads in order to be more active and get encouraged to practice sport

> More customers need to be attracted by this trips and advertised to become subscribers.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> To clarify my key insights i used on purpose simple plots and light color, I used histograms for distributions, Many bar plots to visualize categorical variables, clustered bar charts and some pie charts to show the proportion of variables, Heatmap as well.
